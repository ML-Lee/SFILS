# What I Learned

This project taught me how to:
- Design relational databases using MySQL
- Connect Python to MySQL using `mysql.connector`
- Write secure, parameterized queries
- Structure a real-world backend project
- Use GitHub for version control and collaboration

Challenges included debugging access errors and structuring queries efficiently. I now feel confident building database-driven applications.
